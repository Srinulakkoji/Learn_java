Single responsibility principle :- 
It states that every java class must perform a single functionality. 
Implementation of multiple functionalities in a single class mashup the code.

Assuming a Bank service :-
Inside there are multiple sub-services they are not satisfying that SRP principle by coding
in a single class file as bank services so 
1) OTPService
2) PrinterService
3) LoanService
